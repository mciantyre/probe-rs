use super::{DebugError, DebugInfo, SourceLocation};

/// Program row data that the debugger can use for breakpoints and stepping.
/// To understand how this struct is used, use the following framework:
/// - Everything is calculated from a given machine instruction address, usually the current program counter.
/// - To calculate where the user might step to (step-over, step-into, step-out), we start from the given instruction address/program counter, and work our way through the subsequent sequence of instructions. A sequence of instructions represents a series of contiguous target machine instructions, and does not necessarily represent the whole of a function.
/// - The next address in the target processor's instruction sequence may qualify as (one, or more) of the following:
///   - The start of a new source statement (a source file may have multiple statements on a single line)
///   - Another instruction that is part of the source statement started previously
///   - The first instruction after the end of the sequence epilogue.
///   - The end of the current sequence of instructions.
///   - DWARF defines other flags that are not relevant/used here.
/// - Depending on the combinations of the above, we only use instructions that qualify as:
///   - The beginning of a statement that is neither inside the prologue, nor inside the epilogue.
/// - Based on this, we will attempt to fill the [`HaltLocations`] struct with as many of the four fields as possible, given the available information in the instruction sequence.
/// All data is calculated using the `gimli::read::CompletedLineProgram` as well as, function call data from the debug info frame section.
/// NOTE: Sometimes the target program_counter is at a location where the debug_info program row data does not contain valid statements for halt points, and we will return a DebugError::NoValidHaltLocation . In this case, we recommend the consumer of this API step the core to the next instruction and try again, with a resasonable retry limit.
